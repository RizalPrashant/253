- Reflection: 

  I really enjoyed working on this project. I loved the concept of multi threading and how many processes in
  a sequential program can be threaded and parallely processes to make our code more efficient. The threads are
  later joined together after the processing is done. And for those thread processing to coordinate properly,
  it was important to set alarm signals to hint that a process has ended.
Also, at the time of peer review, I had not done my README so I have done it
after and updated my rubric score for README to be 10/10.
