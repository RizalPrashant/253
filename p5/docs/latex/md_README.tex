\subsection*{Overview}

This project is about using ring buffer, and setting up signals and alarms for a multithreaded code for checkpointing the ring buffer.

\subsection*{Compiling and Using}

It is good to start fresh by using make clean in the terminal. After that, use the command make.

\subsection*{Discussion}

This project was really interesting for me. I had to create alarm and signal for a ring buffer. When I created the signal, I called the dump\-\_\-buffer function on it. Also, I learnt about what a multithreaded code is. A sequential program is divided into many threads which is then processed and joined later. This makes the program faster than normal.

\subsection*{Testing}

For testing, use the code ./backpack.sh \char`\"{}filename to store your test\char`\"{} . Then use cat \char`\"{}filename
you stored your data in\char`\"{} and see if you get a Passing message or not.
