Reflection:
I have a segmentation fault everytime i type something in the smash shell which is why none of my code could
be tested even though I think that my code is mostly correctly parsing args and forking. I had not done the
randomly killing part at the time of peer review.

I have got rid of the seg fault now and my program runs well. Also, I have completed the randomly killing child
processes part.
History command works now. Cd command works too. cd/history does not use fork. fork/exec works without errors.
Randomly kills 25% of processes.
