  - Command history
  - Do you have a max number of entries?  Max Entries 100 
  - What happens when you hit the max history entries? segmentation fault (core dumped)

- Code quality 11/14pts
  - Valgrind  04/7 Memory leak

- Reflection
  When I get to the max entry level,  I get a segmentation fault(core dumped) 
  because of calling a memory overflow. Also, valgrind gave me memory leaks because of not completely clearing the
  allocated memories.
  
  Update: I have now added a return condition to add_history so that when the history.index exceeds 99 it will just
  return and not add anything to the history.
