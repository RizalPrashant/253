## Overview

The main part of this assignment was to familiarize with make, write a makefile and write multiple make targets. It also helps us to understand why build system is important


## Compiling and Using

use command make clean to clean all previous directories.
Then use make command to create an executable named hello.
Simply, type hello to run it.
Also, the test script is run using backpack.sh "somename to store test result" command.

## Discussion

The major process of Makefile was to create the three targes all, run and clean.
Using the all to build the entire executable, run to have dependency on the all target and then
clean to remove all generated files, the make file was completed.I think that this knowledge of 
build system is really important for future projects too since it helps improve efficiency with automation.


## Testing

I tested using the shell script given to me. the backpack.sh shell script helped me test the result against the expected result.
